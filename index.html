    <p>With the release of the Playstation 5 it is time to prove that the PS5 utterly dominates the Xbox Series... something in every way.
        Below I will list the 3 categories that prove PS5 wins

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Exclusives</li>
        <p>Demon's Souls is the best game on PS5 and easily dominates any exclusive that Xbox has. </p>
        <li>Controller</li>
        <p>Haptic feedback combined with the iconic duel sense controller makes for an unrivaled experience.</p>
        <li>UI simplicity</li>
        <p>The Xbox UI is too crowded and full of garbage. Nobody buys a gaming console to watch TV. We have Apple Tv's for that.</p>
    </ol>
